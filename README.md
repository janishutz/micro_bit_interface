# micro_bit_interface
A simple program to interface with the micro:bit through usb

This App allows you (once it is completed) to interface with a micro:bit through USB (if the micro:bit is using MicroPython) or through Bluetooth (if the micro:bit is using a C program). It has a command autocompletion feature, if the micro:bit program has a function to return a list of functions (which is available in the default interface program).
